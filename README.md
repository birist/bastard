Script for trading Cryptocurrencies.

Leverages some basic logic in a console program and a bitmart API to send JSON calls to automatically trade. Intended use to monitor/revise trades and undercut lowest buy/highest sell to try and get a tiny percentage increase of return on each trade, executing a maximum of 60 times a minute.

Script and all BITMART API functions/code written in by me. Binance section was me trying to import an external libray for Binance.
